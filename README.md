Original Addon is: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=510064236 (_TTT Mine Turtle_)                          
my version of it: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=899652214 (_TTT Mine Turtle (added halo)_)

I added a halo so that Traitors can see it through walls.                                                                         
Every time it gets rendered the halo gets a random color so that you definitely see it as traitors on every texture and doesn't run into it.
